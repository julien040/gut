	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command

	// cloneCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	cloneCmd.Flags().BoolP("degit", "d", false, "Clone without git history")
	cloneCmd.Flags().BoolP("verbose", "v", false, "Verbose mode (show git output)")
	cloneCmd.Flags().String("profile", "default", "The alias of the profile to use")
