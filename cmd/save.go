To commit only some files, pass them as arguments to the command.
In case no files are passed as arguments, all files will be committed.

The -e flag allows you to specify the editor to use for writing the commit message.
If you want to use the default Git editor, you can also use the -e flag without any argument (e.g., git save -e).
To specify the editor, use the -e flag followed by the editor command (e.g. gut save -e="mate -w")`,
